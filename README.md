## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving field of generative AI, understanding how models generate content is critical. XAI, or Explainable AI, bridges the gap between complex AI systems and human comprehension. With XAI, you can:

- Visualize the inner workings of generative models.
- Interpret and explain model decisions.
- Improve trust in AI-generated content.

## Features

- **Model Explainability**: XAI provides detailed insights into the generative model's decision-making process.

- **Real-time Interpretation**: Get instant explanations for generated content.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A user-friendly web interface makes it easy for anyone to use and understand.

- **Customization**: Tailor XAI to your specific generative model and dataset.
