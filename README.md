## Introduction

**Generative AI Explainer**, abbreviated as XAI, is an educational breakthrough. In the realm of online learning, we recognized a persistent challenge - the language barrier. To address this, we present a pioneering solution developed for the **Generative AI Hackathon 2024**.

Our project revolves around two core AI models:

### Educational Chatbot

Imagine an AI companion capable of comprehending and responding to questions derived from video content. Our custom educational chatbot leverages a fine-tuned Language Model (LLM) to make this a reality. Whether it's a complex lecture or an instructional video, our chatbot can provide detailed and informative answers, enhancing the learning experience.

### Dubbing Model

In addition to the chatbot, we introduce an advanced dubbing model. This model can seamlessly extract subtitles from YouTube videos and create perfectly synchronized dubbed versions. This groundbreaking technology ensures that educational content is accessible to individuals regardless of their native language, promoting global inclusivity in education.
